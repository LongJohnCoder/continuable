/// The most important class is cti::continuable_base, that provides the
/// whole functionality for continuation chaining.
///
/// The class cti::continuable_base is created through the
/// cti::make_continuable() function which accepts a callback taking function.
///
/// Also there are following support functions available:
/// - cti::when_all() - connects cti::continuable_base's to an `all` connection.
/// - cti::when_any() - connects cti::continuable_base's to an `any` connection.
/// - cti::when_seq() - connects cti::continuable_base's to a sequence.
///
namespace cti {
/// The main class of the continuable library, it provides the functionality
/// for chaining callbacks and continuations together to a unified hierarchy.
///
/// The most important method is the cti::continuable_base::then() method,
/// which allows to attach a callback to the continuable.
///
/// Use the continuable types defined in `continuable/continuable.hpp`,
/// in order to use this class.
///
/// \tparam Data The internal data which is used to store the current
///         continuation and intermediate lazy connection result.
///
/// \tparam Annotation The internal data used to store the current signature
///         hint or strategy used for combining lazy connections.
///
/// \note Nearly all methods of the cti::continuable_base are required to be
///       called as r-value. This is required because the continuable carries
///       variables which are consumed when the object is transformed as part
///       of a method call. You may copy a continuable which underlying
///       storages are copyable to split the call hierarchy into multiple parts.
///
/// \attention The continuable_base objects aren't intended to be stored.
///            If you want to store a continuble_base you should always
///            call the continuable_base::freeze method for disabling the
///            invocation on destruction.
